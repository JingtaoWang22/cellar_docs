Due to the large size of the datasets, Cellar does not implement an online
session manager. Instead, if you wish to save your results and load them at
a later time, you would have to generate an <span class="extension">h5ad</span>
file containing all the data and its annotations. We highly compress the
session file hoping to make the upload and download process faster.
These session files can be useful when you wish to share the results with
another person or team. Anyone with the session file can access the data and
the annotations by uploading the file back to Cellar.

Note, while using the Cellar interface at the provided URL, a session
will die if idle for more than 1 hour. Please save your progress frequently
to avoid any data loss.

* **EXPORT SESSION**
    * This generates a maximally compressed <span class="extension">h5ad</span>
    file containing the data, clusters, annotations, DE genes, and additional
    info about the chosen pipeline. To import the session, simply upload the
    <span class="extension">h5ad</span> as a new dataset in the navigation bar.

* **EXPORT ANNOTATIONS ONLY**
    * Clicking this will download a <span class="extension">csv</span> file with
    the cell barcodes, cluster IDs, and annotations.
